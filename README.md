# Wine-Quality-ML
A wine quality prediction machine learning project typically involves using a dataset of wine samples with corresponding attributes and quality ratings. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the quality of a given wine based on its characteristics.

DATASET The dataset used in this project is the "Wine Quality" dataset, which contains information about different attributes of wine samples along with quality ratings provided by experts. The dataset includes features such as chemical composition, sensory characteristics, and other relevant factors.

DEPENDENCIES Make sure you have the following dependencies installed to run the project: Python (version X.X.X) Pandas (version X.X.X) NumPy (version X.X.X) Scikit-learn (version X.X.X) Matplotlib (version X.X.X) Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)

PROJECT STRUCTURE The project directory is organized as follows:

wine_quality.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. wine_quality.csv: The dataset file. README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.
